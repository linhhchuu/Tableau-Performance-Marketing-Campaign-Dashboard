## Project Summary
In this project, I performed an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation analysis to categorize customers based on their purchasing behaviors. RFM segmentation is a powerful marketing technique that helps businesses understand their customers' value and tailor marketing strategies accordingly. Using Tableau, I visualized the RFM segments to gain insights into customer segments and identify opportunities for targeted marketing campaigns.

## Objectives
- Segment Customers: Classify customers into different segments based on their recency, frequency, and monetary values.
- Visualize RFM Segments: Create interactive dashboards in Tableau to visualize the RFM segments and provide actionable insights.
- Identify Key Customer Segments: Highlight high-value customers and potential churners to inform marketing strategies.

## Methodology
- **Data Collection:** Collected transaction data from an e-commerce platform, including customer IDs, transaction dates, and transaction amounts.
- **Data Preparation:** Cleaned and preprocessed the data to ensure accuracy and completeness.
- **Calculated the RFM values for each customer:**
    - Recency: Days since the last purchase.
    - Frequency: Number of purchases within a specific period.
    - Monetary: Total amount spent by the customer.
- **RFM Scoring:** Assigned scores to each RFM dimension on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest. Combined the scores to create an overall RFM score for each customer.

- **Segmentation:**
    - Grouped customers into segments based on their RFM scores. Typical segments include:
        - Champions: Recent, frequent, and high spenders.
        - Loyal Customers: Frequent buyers with moderate to high spending.
        - Potential Loyalists: Recent buyers with potential to become loyal.
        - At Risk: Customers who haven't purchased in a while.
        - Churned: Customers who haven't purchased for a long time.
- **Visualization:**

Developed interactive dashboards in Tableau to visualize the RFM segments.
Included filters, heat maps, and bar charts to explore the segments and their characteristics.
Results
Customer Insights: Gained a comprehensive understanding of customer behavior and value.
Targeted Marketing: Identified key customer segments for targeted marketing campaigns.
Retention Strategies: Developed strategies to retain high-value customers and re-engage at-risk customers.
Conclusion
The RFM segmentation analysis provided valuable insights into customer behaviors and helped in developing data-driven marketing strategies. By visualizing the segments in Tableau, I was able to create intuitive and actionable dashboards that facilitate informed decision-making. This project demonstrates the effectiveness of RFM segmentation in understanding and optimizing customer relationships.
